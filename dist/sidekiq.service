#
# This file tells systemd how to run Sidekiq as a 24/7 long-running daemon.
#
# Customize this file based on your bundler location, app directory, etc.
# Customize and copy this into /usr/lib/systemd/system (CentOS) or /lib/systemd/system (Ubuntu).
# Then run:
#   - systemctl enable sidekiq
#   - systemctl {start,stop,restart} sidekiq
#
# This file corresponds to a single Sidekiq process.  Add multiple copies
# to run multiple processes (sidekiq-1, sidekiq-2, etc).
#
# Use `journalctl -u sidekiq -rn 100` to view the last 100 lines of log output.

# As of v6.0.6, Sidekiq automatically supports systemd's `Type=notify` and watchdog service
# monitoring. If you are using an earlier version of Sidekiq, change this to `Type=simple`
# and remove the `WatchdogSec` line.
