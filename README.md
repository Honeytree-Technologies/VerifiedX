VerifiedX
=========

VerifiedX is an official project of the [Honeytree Technologies](https://honeytreetech.com) and [Newsie.social,](https://Newsie.social). It serves as a directory and tool to discover and verify accounts on Mastodon and other federated social media platforms.

This beta application is still in its early stages, so users should anticipate occasional bugs, changes, and disruptions.

VerifiedX already powers several sites, including: [VerifiedJournalist.org](https://verifiedjournalist.org), [Lawstodon.org](https://lawstodon.org), and [Verified.thecanadian.social](https://Verified.thecanadian.social), which utilize VerifiedX's searchable directory and verification tools to provide users with accurate and reliable information and engagement metrics on their accounts.

VerifiedX is a valuable resource for anyone seeking to connect their Mastodon account to verified profiles. With Mastodon's vast network of servers and no dedicated team to verify account identities and information, there is a risk of impersonation. By linking their Mastodon account to a VerifiedX profile, users can establish their credibility, legitimacy, and accountability, fostering transparency and trust on the platform.

Furthermore, the service assists readers in discovering and following verified accounts on Mastodon, increasing their visibility and traffic.

The upcoming version of the service will concentrate on tackling federated social media challenges and enhancing the discoverability and value of content and profiles.
